    <p>Modern email protocols were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_privacy#Risks_to_user">never
meant</a> to be
secure.</p>

<p>While there is some theoretical benefit from interacting with your email
over HTTPS, if the recipient happens to be have the same email provider
and the email never leaves the encrypted server, true</p>

<p>Unfortunately just interacting with your email over HTTPS doesn't
secure your communications as much as you should probably want.</p>

<p>The idea that by interacting with your email over HTTPS your
communications are more secure is an absolute fallacy.</p>

<p>When it comes to encrypting your email
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> seems like the
only option worth mentioning. The major downside to PGP is the setup and
the general complexity of how it works. While this makes it a great
cryptographic solution, it makes it difficult for it to become widely
used.</p>

<p>While this guide will focus on PGP usage with mutt, there is probably
some extension for your native email client of choice. If you are not
familiar with mutt I would recommend <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/">The Homely
Mutt</a> to set it up
on your system. There are other, possibly easier, ways to get everything
setup but having used Mutt's native IMAP support previously I would
definitely recommend Steve's method.</p>

    <p>When working with large files in Vim,
<a href="http://majutsushi.github.io/tagbar/">Tagbar</a> has become an invaluable
part of my workflow. It provides a succinct list of methods, modules,
variables and other language specific constructs. When I started trying
to spend more time in Vim writing Objective-C I was disappointed to see
that, out of the box, it was not supported.</p>

<p>Hopefully in the future it won't be difficult to set this up in Vim.
Currently ctags <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ctags/code/trunk/objc.c">already
has</a> built in support
for Objective-C. Unfortunately there hasn't been a release of ctags
since 2009. As recommended in the <a href="http://bastibe.de/2011-12-04-how-to-make-tagbar-work-with-objective-c.html">canonical how to
article</a>
you can attempt to use the trunk version of ctags and just define the
Tagbar settings. For me, this ended up producing a ton of
mis-categorized duplicates. I also opened and closed <a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/issues/193">an
issue</a> on the Tagbar
Github repo hoping that Objective-C support will be added by default in
the future.</p>

<p>The only other resource I could find about this issue was <a href="https://gist.github.com/yamaya/5598909">this
gist</a>. It uses regex to define
Objective-C to ctags and then match it with Tagbar. I improved it a
little bit and came up with this. Put this file anywhere you want, you
will define its path in your vimrc.</p>

<pre><code>--langdef=objc
--langmap=objc:.m..mm..h
--regex-objc=/\@interface[[:space:]]+([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/i,interface/
--regex-objc=/\@implementation[[:space:]]+([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/I,implementation/
--regex-objc=/\@protocol[[:space:]]+([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/P,protocol/
--regex-objc=/\@property[[:space:]]+\([[:alnum:],[:space:]]+\)[[:space:]]+[[:alnum:]_]+[[:space:]]+\*?([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/p,property/

  <div class="post ten columns">
    <p>After you buy a Raspberry Pi, or two, you need to figure out what to use them
for. While you'll get a ton of <em>interesting</em> ideas from Googling "uses for a
Raspberry Pi," I didn't particularly find them any more than a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/10-raspberry-pi-creations-that-show-how-amazing-the-tiny-pc-can-be/">thought
exercise</a>.
Making a VPN stood out as an actually useful configuration.</p>

<p>Originally when I got my (accidentally chosen) Model A, I spent a little
while going through <a href="http://willitscript.com/post/40357408648/using-your-pi-as-a-l2tp-vpn-server">this
guide</a>
using Raspbian. That seemed to work fine until I recently purchased a
Model B to replace it and couldn't reproduce the configuration. I
decided to write the steps that I was finally able to use to get a
functional VPN running on Arch Linux.</p>

<p>I started out by following <a href="https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/IPSEC_L2TP_vpn_on_a_Raspberry_Pi_with_Arch_Linux.html">this
guide</a>
hoping that it would get me a functioning VPN without too much work.  Most of
this setup will be based on that article with some tweaks for what I had to do
to make the settings stick.  Unfortunately while it worked after the setup the
configuration did not persist after restart.  For this configuration, like I
said earlier, I wanted to use the ARM version of Arch Linux rather than
Raspbian for the install. You can download the Raspberry Pi compatible Arch
image from their <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">downloads page</a>. I'm
not sure I would recommend Arch for people who haven't installed it before or
at least gotten through their <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide">Beginners'
Guide</a>. The ARM Image,
like the normal image, doesn't come with a GUI, perfect for this use of the Pi.</p>

<p>I'm not going to bother with making sure this works before restarting, since
that doesn't seem like much of an issue with actual usage (although you can
just run the scripts we create and it should work fine). I wouldn't recommend
doing much configuration before doing this intial setup. I did this the first
time and after an hour of configuration my VPN did not work correctly, I ended
up nuking the work I had done and starting over.</p>

<p>Start by installing the necessary components:</p>

<pre><code>pacman -Sy openswan xl2tpd ppp lsof python2
</code></pre>

<p>You need to do some configuration of the firewall and redirects:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span>  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre></div>


<p>To make these settings persist we need to create a script that gets launched by
systemd each time we restart the system. As recommended in the original
article, and being a <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> user I created the script in
<code>/usr/local/bin/vpn-boot.sh</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/bash</span>

iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --jump MASQUERADE

<span class="k">for </span>vpn in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
<span class="k">    </span><span class="nb">echo </span>0 &gt; <span class="nv">$vpn</span>/accept_redirects<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nb">echo </span>0 &gt; <span class="nv">$vpn</span>/send_redirects<span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">done</span>

sysctl -p
</code></pre></div>


<p>There are a few things that differ here to the original article. First
the hashbang path was changed since the default $PATH on the ARM version
of Arch didn't include <code>/bin</code>. I would run <code>which -a bash</code> on your
install to make sure this works for you. This obviously doesn't have
to be changed, but I think it's better in the long run. I also added
<code>sysctl -p</code> since these settings didn't seemed to be applied otherwise.
Then you must make this script executable with something like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vpn-boot.sh
</code></pre></div>


<p>Since Arch uses systemd to this script has to be launched by creating a
service to be ran through systemd. You can create this file in
<code>/etc/systemd/system/vpnboot.service</code></p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=VPN Settings at boot
After=netctl@eth0.service
Before=openswan.service xl2tpd.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/vpn-boot.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>I added a few things here as well. I wanted to make sure that the boot command
would launch after the network settings had been established and before the
other VPN software was launched. I'm not sure how many of these changes would
be required for systemd to do what I wanted it to but the order really seemed
to matter for here. After you create this service enable it within systemd
with:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl enable vpnboot.service
</code></pre>

<p>I also made some changes to <code>/etc/ipsec.conf</code> (note the comments in the
default file for some more info on these settings):</p>

<pre><code>config setup
  dumpdir=/var/run/pluto/
  nat_traversal=yes
  virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12,%v4:25.0.0.0/8,%v6:fd00::/8,%v6:fe80::/10
  oe=off
  protostack=netkey
  plutoopts="--interface=eth0"

conn L2TP-PSK-noNAT
  authby=secret
  pfs=no
  auto=add
  keyingtries=3
  ikelifetime=8h
  keylife=1h
  type=transport
  # Your server's IP (I used my internal IP, assuming you're using NAT)
  left=172.16.1.1
  leftprotoport=17/1701
  right=%any
  rightprotoport=17/%any
  rightsubnetwithin=0.0.0.0/0
  dpddelay=10
  dpdtimeout=20
  dpdaction=clear
</code></pre>

<p>Then for the <code>/etc/ipsec.secrets</code> (use the same server IP address):</p>

<pre><code>%SameIP%  %any: PSK "super random key"
</code></pre>

<p>The make systemd start openswan on boot as well:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl enable openswan
</code></pre>

<p>I also edited the openswan service file in
<code>/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openswan.service</code></p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Openswan daemon
After=netctl@eth0.service vpnboot.service
Before=xl2tpd.service

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/ipsec --start
ExecStop=/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/ipsec --stop
ExecReload=/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/ipsec --restart
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I removed the original network dependency and added a new
dependency of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl">netctl's</a>
default network interface (we haven't enabled this yet).</p>

<p>Next for <code>/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[global]
ipsec saref = yes
saref refinfo = 30

[lns default]
ip range = 172.16.1.70-172.16.1.89
local ip = 172.16.1.1
require authentication = yes
ppp debug = yes
pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd
length bit = yes
unix authentication = yes
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>local ip</code> is the server's ip and the <code>ip range</code> is the range of
IP addresses you want to use for VPN clients. You need to enable this
service too with:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl enable xl2tpd
</code></pre>

<p>I also edited the systemd file for xl2tpd at
<code>/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/xl2tpd.service</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Level 2 Tunnel Protocol Daemon (L2TP)
After=syslog.target netctl@eth0.service openswan.service
Requires=openswan.service

[Service]
Type=simple
PIDFile=/run/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.pid
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xl2tpd -D
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>The other guide also recommends creating the xl2tpd control folder with:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /var/run/xl2tpd/
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to create/edit <code>/etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
ms-dns 8.8.8.8
ms-dns 8.8.4.4
auth
mtu 1200
mru 1000
crtscts
hide-password
modem
name l2tpd
proxyarp
lcp-echo-interval 30
lcp-echo-failure 4
login
</code></pre>

<p><code>/etc/pam.d/ppp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>auth    required        pam_nologin.so
auth    required        pam_unix.so
account required        pam_unix.so
session required        pam_unix.so
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</code>:</p>

<pre><code>*       l2tpd           ""              *
</code></pre>

<p>If you'd like you can also restrict the users accounts that can access
the vpn. This way you can separate your login user from your VPN users
who can have much stronger passwords. You'd do that in your
<code>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</code>:</p>

<pre><code>vpnuser   l2tpd         ""              *
</code></pre>

<p>To enable the startup of the default netctl eth0 interface you need to
run:</p>

<pre><code>netctl enable eth0
</code></pre>

<p>You'll probably want to disable any other netctl systemd functions that are
enabled by default. Check <code>/etc/systemd/system/mutli-user.target.wants</code> to for
other <code>netctl</code> profiles.</p>

<p>So at this point you should be able to enable VPN clients using the
super secret keys you enabled before and the username and passwords
you've created previously. You can create new users for specifically VPN
usage with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>useradd -s /sbin/nologin vpnuser
</code></pre>

<p>This disallows users from being able to be used for login which is probably
more secure for your VPN (although not required). For testing you can use the
root/root defualt user and a less secure key, although you should <em>definitely</em>
change these before allowing access to the outside world.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly you'll have to deal with something that doesn't work exactly
how my setup works. The most useful things to seeing what was happening
were these:</p>

<pre><code>netstat -tulpan
systemctl status openswan
systemctl status xl2tpd
journalctl -f
</code></pre>

<p>You can glance at some of the other guides to see what should be going
on. You probably shouldn't see any red in the <code>openswan</code> status and you
should see ports open under <code>pluto</code> with netstat. You can check out the
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/ipsec.conf">ipsec manpage</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/xelerance/Openswan/wiki/L2tp-ipsec-configuration-using-openswan-and-xl2tpd">openswan
wiki
page</a>
for a little more information on some of the settings. Also I used <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">this
page</a>
for some more info on how systemd settings work. Please let me know if
there's anything here that could be done easier/better for this
configuration.</p>

    <p>One of the great things about Vim's textual configuration is it's
ability to contain logic based on outside factors. For the purpose of
this post I'm referring to the ability to set your colorscheme based on
the time of day with something like
<a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/a34e432b59e26225ebdb05737b30729b7ea670d9/vimrc#L102-L108">this</a>.</p>

made me want this in <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm</a> as

to this. The closest you get is profiles which you can assign keyboard
shortcuts to for quickly opening windows with different colorschemes.

<a href="https://twitter.com/junkiesxl">Piet Jaspers</a>, support was added for
scripting iTerm's entire colorscheme with AppleScript. Using these
AppleScript bindings I was able to create a
<a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/itermcolors.applescript">script</a>
that changes the entire colorscheme of iTerm based on the time of day
between Solarized light and dark. As you can see the
<a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/itermcolors.applescript#L27-L49">bulk</a>
of this script is just setting different color attributes based on the
theme you want. While you could do this conversion by hand to 65535
flavored RGB, I made a
tiny Objective-C app to automate the process which is <a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/ColorConvert">on
Github</a>. You can download
the signed binary
<a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/ColorConvert/releases/tag/1.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Using this newly created AppleScript I then made a zsh
<a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/master/functions/colorize">function</a> so that I could call <code>colorize</code> from anywhere to update the color scheme of the current terminal.
I also chose to do this at the end of my <code>.zshrc</code> <a href="https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/763e6f3f2bbcd93775c70e0d9ed9878ac99896a3/zshrc#L51">here</a>.
This way everytime I open a new session my theme is automatically set.</p>

<p>If you have any input on how I could optimize this let me know.</p>

    <p>When starting a new web project one of the first things I do is download
the most up to date <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.
It provides a great starting point for the HTML you need in a project.
It also comes with an extremely complete <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.htaccess">.htaccess</a>
file. While this is very nice for a single site they recommend you do
something different for multiple sites at <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/21c614849afc5b518685b68d81d2b0c8f7971f0a/.htaccess#L4-L6">the very top</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(!) Using .htaccess files slows down Apache, therefore, if you have access
to the main server config file (usually called httpd.conf), you should add
this logic there: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html.</p></blockquote>

<p>This got me to their awesome collection of <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs">server configs</a>
which has their, and in many ways the communities, recommended settings
depending on your webserver. The <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache">apache configs</a>
have the same <code>.htaccess</code> file so I decided to dig into how to do this.</p>

<p>They direct you to the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html">apache article</a>
about using <code>.htaccess</code> files which has a similar comment about their
use.</p>

<blockquote><p>You should avoid using .htaccess files completely if you have access to httpd main server config file
Using .htaccess files slows down your Apache http server. Any directive that you can include in a
.htaccess file is better set in a Directory block, as it will have the same effect with better performance.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I decided to set this up on my <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c190426bf1ff0f144b48997675bae8b32d339824">Linode VPS</a> which is running Ubuntu 10.04.
As stated in the original file comment they recommend using the
<code>httpd.conf</code> file for your custom configuration like this. But
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11687212/902968">apparently</a> that file could be
overwritten on updates of Apache which would be pretty annoying. Luckily
the default Apache config file (<code>apache2.conf</code> on 10.04) includes the
contents of the <code>conf.d</code> folder which is in the same location. By
creating a <code>foo.conf</code> file in that directory Apache should immediately
load its contents. As mentioned in the comment from the Apache site the
custom configuration needs to be wrapped in a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory">Directory</a> block.
The block expects you to provide a path to the files you want to be
affected by the contained configuration. Since I wanted this to work for
all the sites being served by Apache I simply used <code>/srv/www/*/</code> which
includes my entire sites directory.</p>

<p>Besides the speed increased gained by using a global <code>.htaccess</code> file
this allows you to have much shorter custom files for site specific
configuration. For example only required configuration for one of my sites
was the <code>ErrorDocument</code>s. Now my <code>.htaccess</code> file went from 300+ lines
to</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">403</span> <span class="sx">/403.php</span>
<span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">404</span> <span class="sx">/404.php</span>
<span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">500</span> <span class="sx">/500.php</span>
</code></pre></div>
