I haven't had anything to write in a while. Mainly because, as I've been
working at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), I've been writing
everything I can on [the thoughtbot
blog](https://robots.thoughtbot.com). I spent a little while writing
[Clojure](http://clojure.org), and out of that came a few posts.

Overall I wasn't a big fan of Clojure. I definitely lean more towards
functional languages [with types](https://www.haskell.org) but I wanted
to link these articles here regardless.
