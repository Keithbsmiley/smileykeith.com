    <p>When starting a new web project one of the first things I do is download
the most up to date <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.
It provides a great starting point for the HTML you need in a project.
It also comes with an extremely complete <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.htaccess">.htaccess</a>
file. While this is very nice for a single site they recommend you do
something different for multiple sites at <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/21c614849afc5b518685b68d81d2b0c8f7971f0a/.htaccess#L4-L6">the very top</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(!) Using .htaccess files slows down Apache, therefore, if you have access
to the main server config file (usually called httpd.conf), you should add
this logic there: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html.</p></blockquote>

<p>This got me to their awesome collection of <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs">server configs</a>
which has their, and in many ways the communities, recommended settings
depending on your webserver. The <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache">apache configs</a>
have the same <code>.htaccess</code> file so I decided to dig into how to do this.</p>

<p>They direct you to the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html">apache article</a>
about using <code>.htaccess</code> files which has a similar comment about their
use.</p>

<blockquote><p>You should avoid using .htaccess files completely if you have access to httpd main server config file
Using .htaccess files slows down your Apache http server. Any directive that you can include in a
.htaccess file is better set in a Directory block, as it will have the same effect with better performance.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I decided to set this up on my <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c190426bf1ff0f144b48997675bae8b32d339824">Linode VPS</a> which is running Ubuntu 10.04.
As stated in the original file comment they recommend using the
<code>httpd.conf</code> file for your custom configuration like this. But
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11687212/902968">apparently</a> that file could be
overwritten on updates of Apache which would be pretty annoying. Luckily
the default Apache config file (<code>apache2.conf</code> on 10.04) includes the
contents of the <code>conf.d</code> folder which is in the same location. By
creating a <code>foo.conf</code> file in that directory Apache should immediately
load its contents. As mentioned in the comment from the Apache site the
custom configuration needs to be wrapped in a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory">Directory</a> block.
The block expects you to provide a path to the files you want to be
affected by the contained configuration. Since I wanted this to work for
all the sites being served by Apache I simply used <code>/srv/www/*/</code> which
includes my entire sites directory.</p>

<p>Besides the speed increased gained by using a global <code>.htaccess</code> file
this allows you to have much shorter custom files for site specific
configuration. For example only required configuration for one of my sites
was the <code>ErrorDocument</code>s. Now my <code>.htaccess</code> file went from 300+ lines
to</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">403</span> <span class="sx">/403.php</span>
<span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">404</span> <span class="sx">/404.php</span>
<span class="nb">ErrorDocument</span> <span class="m">500</span> <span class="sx">/500.php</span></code></pre></div>
