  <div class="post ten columns">
    <p>As you may know I write a small OS X called <a href="http://sailforapp.net/">Sail</a>. Over
the past few months that it has been available I've received a few crash reports
about an issue I wasn't able to reproduce. Today I decided I wanted to dive into
them and see if I could at least figure out the root of the issue and fix it
with my next release.</p>

<p>This lead me down the rabbit hole of
<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/symbolication.html">symbolication</a>, something I personally
hadn't dealt with myself before (since Crashlytics does it for you). I was
hoping I would be able to find something around the internet about this,
unfortunately what I mostly came up with was a lot of iOS related answers that
didn't seem to work the same way and
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/symbolizingcrashdumps.html">two</a>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2004/tn2123.html">links</a> to
Apple documentation that have been removed. Other than the process for
symbolicating reports for OS X apps seems to be different than iOS apps which
there is plenty of documentation for (I'm not bitter). Daniel Jalkut has <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/439/crappy-crash-logs">a
post</a> about these but his
exact method didn't seem to work for me.</p>

<p>Here is what did work for me. For my first abridged crash report I had this</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just glancing at this crash report it's not too difficult to understand a bit
about what was going on. A notification was sent, some methods were called in my
application and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifier</code> was called. Based on
the small number of times I call that method I was quickly able to assume where
the issue was but I still wanted to see exactly what methods of mine were being
called first.</p>

<p>This brings me to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atos</code> the command line tool Apple provides to symbolicate
these reports. This is where my experience differs with most of what I found
online. My usage looked like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>atos -arch x86_64 -o Sail.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Sail -l 0x106823000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This uses my dSYM file that was generated with the archive build I submitted to
the app store along with the knowledge that it was running on an x86_64
architecture and the most important part, for me, the load address.</p>

<p>To find my dSYM file that was generated when I did my archive build I simply
noted the version and build number from the crash report, went to the Archives
tab in the Xcode organizer, found the build with the same number, right clicked
and clicked "Show in Finder." This takes you directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcarchive</code> file
on disk which you can right click and click "Show Package Contents." From there
I copied my dSYM to the desktop so I didn't overwrite anything unintentionally.</p>

<p>The load address is the starting memory address of your application. The tool
uses this address as an offset to find the correct methods in your symbols. In
the above crash report <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Load Address</code> is a provided field. This was the only
report I saw that had that, typically I needed to look under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binary Images</code>
section for the address range of my application. In this example it was
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x106823000 - 0x106896fff</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atos</code> command then provides an interactive prompt where you can paste
addresses into the stdin and it will tell you the corresponding methods. Mine
looked like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0x00000001068308f7
-[KSAccountsPreferences dealloc] (in Sail) (KSAccountsPreferences.m:77)
0x0000000106830798
-[KSAccountsPreferences viewDidLoad] (in Sail) (KSAccountsPreferences.m:73)
0x0000000106825249
-[KSAppDelegate openAboutWindow:] (in Sail) (KSAppDelegate.m:59)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here I can see that the notification that was being posted was probably an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApplicationDidFinishLaunchingNotification</code> starting off some methods in my
app delegate. I then load the accounts preferences, which would make sense to
call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACAccountStore</code> method, but then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dealloc</code> is called. Seeing this was
an immediate red flag since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KSAccountsPreferences</code> should be retained since it
provides information about available accounts to the rest of the application.</p>

<p>I had another crash report from a different issue that was a little bit harder
to parse without symbolicating the methods.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously this was caused by an invalid access to an array but that's a little harder to track down. So I again used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atos</code> with the dSYM and new memory location.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>atos -arch x86_64 -o Sail.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Sail -l 0x10b82a000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I got this output for my memory addresses</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0x000000010b838eed
-[KSAccountsPreferences selectedADNUser] (in Sail) (KSAccountsPreferences.m:238)
0x000000010b838f36
-[KSAccountsPreferences selectTwitterUsername] (in Sail) (KSAccountsPreferences.m:243)
0x000000010b838b19

0x000000010b83785d
__36-[KSAccountsPreferences viewDidLoad]_block_invoke (in Sail) (KSAccountsPreferences.m:70)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ended up giving me the exact line where out of bounds issue was happening
depending on a certain number of accounts. I noticed that this issue had been
fixed since my last release so I did a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> on the tag I created for that
specific release with</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git difftool HEAD..1.2.0\(3\)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then in <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a> I was able to figure out
what changed had fixed the issue. Just because it's so pretty here is what it
looked like.</p>

<p>Symbolicating crash reports is definitely vital to tracking down bugs your users
are experiencing when you can't reproduce them yourself. Once you figure out how
it's obviously worth it.</p>
